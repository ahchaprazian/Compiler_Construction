## BMinor Compiler Construction
Semester project implementing different parts of a compiler to work with the BMinor language.

This repository contains the Bminor compiler project utilizing the examples and textbook by [Douglas Thain](https://github.com/dthain/compilerbook-examples)
The following project completed the scanner, parser, pretty printer, and type checker for the compiler as defined in the course outline. The compiler
still needs bugs to be cleaned for the type checker, but aside from that, all other aspects are fully functional.

# Learning Objectives 

**Lexical Analysis (Scanner):**
- Learned about lexical analysis and efficient tokenizer design.
- Recognized tokens using regular expressions.
- Managed complex token patterns (identifiers, numbers, strings).
- Used regex to understand how to handle comments and white space

**Parsing (Parser):**
- Gained insights into formal grammars and parsing techniques.
- Constructed a robust syntax tree representing the language's grammar.
- Dealt with ambiguous grammar rules carefully for correct parsing.

**Pretty Printing:**
- Improved readability and formatting of the syntax tree.
- Facilitated debugging and understanding of intermediate compiler stages.
- Ensured the generated code maintains original program layout.

**Type Checking:**
- Learned about type inference algorithms.
- Managed polymorphic types and type compatibility.
- Detected type errors early in the compilation process.

**Challenges Faced:**
- Addressed error handling and memory management challenges.
- Optimized parser efficiency and grammar handling.
- Managed symbol table and scope resolution for type checking.
- Ensured accurate type validation in the symbol table.

**Overall Learning:**
- Comprehensively understood compiler construction phases.
- Gained knowledge of programming language theory.
- Developed skills in building a reliable and efficient compiler for a specific language.
- Implementing the scanner in the compiler project taught us about lexical analysis and the importance of designing an efficient tokenizer that recognizes tokens based on regular expressions. We learned to handle complex token patterns, such as regular expressions for identifiers, numbers, and strings, and handle comments and whitespace properly.
